# micro-channel

This is a channel for [Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) to congregate any plugins not in the [offical Micro channel](https://github.com/micro-editor/plugin-channel).  
The goal of this is to be quicker than the official channel.

Want a plugin/theme added? Open a new issue, or submit a pull request. I should be quick to add it.

## How To Use

1. Open up your `settings.json` for Micro (can be found using `eval "messenger:Message(configDir)"`)
2. Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sum01/micro-channel/master/channel.json` to your `pluginchannels`, like so...

```
"pluginchannels": [
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micro-editor/plugin-channel/master/channel.json",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sum01/micro-channel/master/channel.json"
],
```

3. Restart Micro, and then all the plugins should be searchable/installable.

# Plugin List

Note that I won't personally test each and every plugin, and make no promises about the quality of them.
